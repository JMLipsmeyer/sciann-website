Have questions or like collaborations, email Ehsan Haghighat . Getting started: 30 seconds to SciANN The core data structure of SciANN is a Functional , a way to organize inputs ( Variables ) and outputs ( Fields ) of a network. Targets are imposed on Functional instances using Constraint s. The SciANN model ( SciModel ) is formed from inputs ( Variables ) and targets( Constraints ). The model is then trained by calling the solve function. Here is the simplest SciANN model: from sciann import Variable, Functional, SciModel from sciann.constraints import Data x = Variable('x') y = Functional('y') # y_true is a Numpy array of (N,1) -- with N as number of samples. model = SciModel(x, Data(y)) This is associated to the simplest neural network possible, i.e. a linear relation between the input variable x and the output variable y with only two parameters to be learned. Plotting a network is as easy as passing a file_name to the SciModel: model = SciModel(x, Data(y), plot_to_file='file_path') Once your model looks good, perform the learning with .solve() : # x_true is a Numpy array of (N,1) -- with N as number of samples. model.train(x_true, y_true, epochs=5, batch_size=32) You can iterate on your training data in batches and in multiple epochs. Please check Keras documentation on model.fit for more information on possible options. You can evaluate the model any time on new data: classes = model.predict(x_test, batch_size=128) In the examples folder of the repository, you will find some examples of Linear Elasticity, Flow, Flow in Porous Media, etc. Installation Before installing SciANN, you need to install the TensorFlow and Keras. TensorFlow installation instructions . Keras installation instructions . You may also consider installing the following optional dependencies : cuDNN (recommended if you plan on running Keras on GPU). HDF5 and h5py (required if you plan on saving Keras/SciANN models to disk). graphviz and pydot (used by visualization utilities to plot model graphs). Then, you can install SciANN itself. There are two ways to install SciANN: Install SciANN from PyPI (recommended): Note: These installation steps assume that you are on a Linux or Mac environment. If you are on Windows, you will need to remove sudo to run the commands below. sudo pip install sciann If you are using a virtualenv, you may want to avoid using sudo: pip install sciann Alternatively: install SciANN from the GitHub source: First, clone SciANN using git : git clone https://github.com/sciann/sciann.git Then, cd to the SciANN folder and run the install command: sudo python setup.py install or sudo pip install . Why this name, SciANN? Scientific Computational with Artificial Neural Networks.
